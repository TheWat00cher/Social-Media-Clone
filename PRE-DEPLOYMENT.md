# 🎯 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Complete these tasks BEFORE starting deployment to ensure a smooth process.

## 📝 Code Preparation

- [ ] All features tested locally and working
- [ ] No console errors in browser (F12)
- [ ] No errors in backend terminal
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install` in both frontend & backend)
- [ ] Code committed to Git
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public or you have deployment permissions

## 🔍 Code Review

- [ ] Remove any hardcoded API URLs
- [ ] Verify `api.js` uses `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`
- [ ] Verify backend CORS uses `process.env.CLIENT_URL` or `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN`
- [ ] No sensitive data in code (passwords, API keys)
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` files created for reference

## 📦 Project Structure

- [ ] `frontend/` folder exists with React app
- [ ] `backend/` folder exists with Express app
- [ ] Both have separate `package.json` files
- [ ] Backend has `src/server.js` as entry point
- [ ] Frontend has `src/index.js` and `public/index.html`

## 🔐 Security Check

- [ ] No `.env` files committed to Git
- [ ] No API keys or secrets in code
- [ ] Strong passwords ready for database
- [ ] JWT secret ready (minimum 32 random characters)
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes `.env`, `node_modules`, `build`, `uploads`

## 📊 Accounts You'll Need

Prepare these accounts (you can create them during deployment):

- [ ] GitHub account (already have)
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account (will create)
- [ ] Cloudinary account (will create)
- [ ] Railway account (will create - sign in with GitHub)
- [ ] Vercel account (will create - sign in with GitHub)

## 💾 Credentials to Prepare

Have these ready:

- [ ] Strong password for MongoDB user
- [ ] Random 32+ character string for JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Email access for account verifications
- [ ] GitHub authentication access

## 🛠️ Required Information

Know these about your project:

- [ ] GitHub repository URL: ________________
- [ ] GitHub username: ________________
- [ ] Project name: ________________
- [ ] Backend port (usually 5000): ________________
- [ ] Frontend port (usually 3000): ________________

## 📱 Testing Preparation

- [ ] Create test user credentials you'll use:
  - Username: ________________
  - Email: ________________
  - Password: ________________

## ⏱️ Time Allocation

Expect to spend:
- MongoDB Atlas setup: ~5 minutes
- Cloudinary setup: ~3 minutes
- Railway backend deployment: ~10 minutes
- Vercel frontend deployment: ~8 minutes
- CORS configuration: ~2 minutes
- Testing: ~5 minutes
- **Total: ~30-40 minutes**

## 📚 Documentation Ready

Have these files open:

- [ ] [QUICK-DEPLOY.md](./QUICK-DEPLOY.md) - Quick reference
- [ ] [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) - Detailed guide
- [ ] [DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md) - Progress tracker
- [ ] Notepad for saving URLs and credentials

## 🌐 Browser Setup

- [ ] Modern browser ready (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Multiple tabs open for:
  - GitHub
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - Cloudinary
  - Railway
  - Vercel
- [ ] Password manager ready (optional but recommended)

## 💡 Knowledge Check

Understand these concepts:

- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Frontend vs Backend deployment
- [ ] Database connection strings

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

Read and understand:

- [ ] **Never commit `.env` files** - They contain secrets
- [ ] **Save all credentials securely** - You'll need them later
- [ ] **Test locally first** - Don't deploy broken code
- [ ] **Free tiers have limits** - Monitor usage
- [ ] **CORS must match exactly** - No trailing slashes, exact URLs
- [ ] **Use HTTPS in production** - Not HTTP

## 🎯 Final Check

- [ ] Code is working perfectly locally
- [ ] You have 30-40 minutes of uninterrupted time
- [ ] You're ready to create new accounts
- [ ] You have notepad ready for credentials
- [ ] You understand you'll need to save important URLs
- [ ] You're mentally prepared for some troubleshooting

## 🆘 Not Ready Yet?

If you're missing checks:

- **Code not working?** → Fix locally first, test thoroughly
- **GitHub not set up?** → Commit and push your code
- **Not enough time?** → Come back when you have 40 minutes
- **Confused about concepts?** → Read [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) first
